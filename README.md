# Library-Recommenations

UC Berkeley has over 40,000 students enrolled and more 15 libraries. Finding study space is hard for most students, especially during finals and mid-terms and review week. 

However, after a few interviews conducted with the Library Staff it was revealed that the college had enough study space to meet the needs of most students but a lot of space was under utilized.
Most students flocked to the central library or other main libraries to study and many were unaware of all the department specific libraries which were located on campus. 

This project looks at hourly sensor data for UC Berkeley libraries for one year to monitor traffic in the libraries and suggest students the best time to visit a given library or help a student find a library that suits their preferences. 

The materials included in this repository are:
1. Hourly sensor data
2. Project Report
3. Python Script (note: the charts will only show up if the Ipython notebook is run)
